# Creepy Voice Requirements <h1>
1. Use python webscraping libraries/frameworks.
2. Scrape either Dictionary.com or another dictionary website.
3. If the data is too large to preprocess, the program will retrieve the sounds when the user enters a string. Otherwise preprocess it.
4. User has the option to add an effect to the voice(lower voice, faster voice).
5. The program will then save that sound to a default or specified location. 
6. The program will play the sound back to the user.
7. The user then will be able to enter another string or quit.
