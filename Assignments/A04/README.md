The driver.php should run the examples correctly using query_function.php and config.php. 
Currently php is not recognizing my sql queries that worked in the cs2 database.
I think it's a problem with mysqli syntax, becuase the example query givin to us which doesn't
use any commands like "group by" seems to work just fine.
