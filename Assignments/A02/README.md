# Powershell 6(scripting)
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-6

Powershell is a shell that microsoft made to eventually replace the windows command prompt.
I didn't even know that powershell was on my system until I tried making a  batch script.
I eventually learned what I wanted to do was way easier to do in powershell.
Powershell is a lot more powerful and accessible than command prompt.
I think it would be useful to get a better understanding of it.
